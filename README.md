Description: 
The SunRunr application is a web application for monitoring your outdoor fitness activities, sun exposure, and weather conditions during walking, running, and biking. This web application was created using the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) which is a part of Amazon Web Services (AWS). 

Link To Server:
Edit: The server is not currently up and running because I had to take it down since my AWS free trial was almost over. This can be run remotely or I can put it back online if needed. Thanks!
